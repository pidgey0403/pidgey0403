I've been fascinated with artifical intelligence, virtual reality, and anything and everything sci-fi related since my early-teens! I'm passionate about learning new frameworks and languages, and even more passionate about using my knowledge to elegantly solve complex problems. I also love creatively solving real-world challenges to implement solutions that are efficient and purposeful.
