# Hey there 👋🏼, I'm Gabrielle Niamat! 

I'm a third year CS student at Western University, currently working as a programming instructor at Alpha Coding. My hometown is Toronto, Ontario 🇨🇦

I'm passionate about learning new things and creating elegant solutions to complex problems 💻, whether it be in my data structures and algorithms classes, or just trying to debug null pointer exceptions in my personal projects. ![cry](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/eb/5b/c7eb5bbae52025b4d2ad9b8224022bd4.gif)
